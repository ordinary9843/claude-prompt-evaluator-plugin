description: Scores any Claude Code markdown artifact or directory against Anthropic official best practices and produces an actionable A–F grade report. Auto-detects the target type from the path: a directory triggers a full weighted audit; a SKILL.md, agent .md, .claude/commands/*.md, .claude/rules/*.md, MEMORY.md, .claude/output-styles/*.md, context file, or CLAUDE.md each triggers the appropriate rubric automatically. No path = current directory. Use when the user asks to "review", "score", "audit", "grade", "check quality", "evaluate", or "what's wrong with" any Claude Code file or directory.

# Review Any Claude Code Artifact

Scores a single file or an entire plugin directory. Auto-detects what it's reviewing.

## Step 1 — Detect the target

Accept `$ARGUMENTS` as the target path. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, use the current working directory.

If the path refers to a file (not a directory) and does not end in `.md`, report: `Error: '<path>' is not a .md file — only markdown artifacts are reviewed.`

| Condition | Type |
|-----------|------|
| Path is a directory | `plugin-dir` |
| Filename is `SKILL.md` | `skill` |
| File is inside an `agents/` directory and ends in `.md` (not an example/template) | `agent` |
| Filename is `CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.local.md` | `claude-md` |
| File is inside a `rules/` directory and ends in `.md` | `rule` |
| File is inside a `commands/` directory and ends in `.md` | `command` |
| Filename is `MEMORY.md` or file is inside a `memory/` directory and ends in `.md` | `memory` |
| File is inside `output-styles/` and ends in `.md` | `output-style` |
| File is inside a skill or agent directory, ends in `.md`, AND is not `SKILL.md` or the agent file (e.g., `template.md`, `examples/output.md`) | `context` |
| Path is a `rules/` or `commands/` directory | `rules-dir` |

> Note: Commands, rules, and output styles must be under `.claude/` (or `~/.claude/` for global). CLAUDE.md can be placed at project root or any subdirectory.

If the path does not exist, report: `Error: '<path>' not found — stopping.`
If the path resolves to an empty file, report: `Error: '<path>' is empty — nothing to review.`
If the path is a file and none of the above conditions matched, report: `Error: '<path>' is not a recognized artifact type — stopping.`
If the path is a directory containing no Claude Code artifacts (SKILL, agent, rules, commands, memory, output-style, context, CLAUDE.md), report: `Error: no Claude Code artifacts found in '<path>'.`

## Step 2 — Score using the appropriate precision tier

### Tier 1: Fast Review (default)
Always start here. Load the criteria file for the detected artifact type from `skills/review/references/`. Score the artifact using only the checks and point values defined in that file. Do not apply criteria not present in the loaded file.

| Artifact type  | Load this file from `skills/review/references/` |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `skill`        | `skill-criteria.md`                              |
| `agent`        | `agent-criteria.md`                              |
| `claude-md`    | `claude-md-criteria.md`                          |
| `rule`         | `rules-criteria.md`                              |
| `command`      | `command-criteria.md`                            |
| `memory`       | `memory-criteria.md`                             |
| `output-style` | `output-style-criteria.md`                       |
| `context`      | `context-criteria.md`                            |

Do not inline rubric tables. Use only the loaded references/ file for scoring checks and point values.

### Tier 2: Deep Audit (escalation)
After Tier 1 scoring, escalate to the `auditor` agent (which loads `skills/review/references/` criteria) in these cases:
- **Directory audit**: always escalate (skip Tier 1 entirely, delegate immediately)
- **Boundary score**: if Tier 1 score lands at 85–90, re-score with Tier 2 for precise A vs B grading
- **Explicit request**: user asks for "deep audit", "detailed review", or "expert review"

Tier 2 score is always final — do not re-escalate back to Tier 1.

### plugin-dir weighted score

The `auditor` agent owns the weighted formula for directory audits. See `agents/auditor.md` for the full breakdown.

If a component is absent, redistribute its weight proportionally to the remaining components.

Read each component file once. For each component, load its corresponding references/ file and score against it.

## Step 3 — Output format

### Single file

```markdown
## Review: `<path>`   Score: XX/100 — Grade X

| Dimension | Score | Max | Finding       |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------------|
| <name>    | XX    | XX  | one-line note |

### Issues
1. [+N pts] <field or line> — what's wrong → concrete fix
2. ...

### Top 3 improvements (by point impact)
```

### Directory

```markdown
## Plugin Audit: `<name>`   Overall: XX/100 — Grade X

| Component           | Score      | Grade | Top issue |
|---------------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Skills (N)          | XX/100     | X     | one-line  |
| Agents (N)          | XX/100     | X     | one-line  |

| **OVERALL**         | **XX/100** | **X** |           |


### Top 5 actions (highest point impact across the plugin)
1. [+N pts] `file` — action
```

### Examples

The following show what the above templates produce with real input.

#### Example: single file

**Input**: `skills/review/SKILL.md`

```markdown
## Review: `skills/review/SKILL.md`   Score: 82/100 — Grade B

| Dimension                 | Score | Max | Finding                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A. Trigger Precision      | 15    | 15  | All checks pass                                                     |
| B. Instruction Clarity    | 25    | 25  | All checks pass                                                     |
| C. Examples & Output      | 16    | 20  | All three example types present; single-file example slightly stale |
| D. Progressive Disclosure | 15    | 15  | 178 lines; criteria fully loaded from references/                   |
| E. Advanced Features      | 7     | 10  | allowed-tools not declared — read-only skill should specify Read, Grep, Glob |
| F. Structure & Safety     | 15    | 15  | All checks pass                                                     |

### Issues
1. [+3 pts] E2 — `allowed-tools` not declared in frontmatter → add `allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob` (read-only skill; no write or execute access needed).
2. [+2 pts] C — Example variety: add a second single-file example for a different artifact type (e.g., an agent review) to show output format generalises beyond skills.

### Top 3 improvements (by point impact)
1. [+3 pts] Add `allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob` to frontmatter
2. [+2 pts] Add a second single-file example for an agent artifact type
3. [+1 pt] Expand directory audit example to show all component types populated
```

#### Example: path not found (failure case)

**Input**: `skills/missing/SKILL.md`

```text
Error: `skills/missing/SKILL.md` not found — stopping.
```

#### Example: directory audit

**Input**: `.` (plugin root)

```markdown
## Plugin Audit: `claude-prompt-evaluator-plugin`   Overall: 91/100 — Grade A

| Component   | Score      | Grade | Top issue                                          |
|-------------|------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Skills (2)  | 85/100     | B     | Both skills missing concrete input→output examples |
| Agents (2)  | 93/100     | A     | auditor.md description exceeds recommended length  |
| Rules (2)   | 88/100     | B     | security.md has vague principles                   |
| CLAUDE.md   | 97/100     | A     | 5,759 chars just over the <5k full-marks threshold |
| **OVERALL** | **90/100** | **A** |                                                    |

### Top 5 actions (highest point impact across the plugin)
1. [+2.4 pts overall] `skills/review/SKILL.md` — add 2 concrete filled-in review examples
2. [+1.2 pts overall] `skills/fix/SKILL.md` — add disable-model-invocation and allowed-tools to frontmatter
3. [+0.8 pts overall] `agents/auditor.md` — shorten description to under 200 characters
4. [+0.6 pts overall] `.claude/rules/security.md` — rewrite vague principles to specific imperatives
```

## Tone rules

- Cite exact field names, line numbers, or quoted text for every issue.
- Every issue must include a concrete fix, not just a complaint.
- This skill is **read-only**: never write or modify files.
- If a score is >= 90, output only the score table and a brief congratulatory note. Omit the Issues and Top 3 sections entirely.
